        The Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by European manufacturer Airbus.[6][7] It is the world's largest passenger airliner, and the airports at which it operates have upgraded facilities to accommodate it. It was initially named Airbus A3XX and designed to challenge Boeing's monopoly in the large-aircraft market. The A380 made its first flight on 27 April 2005 and entered commercial service on 25 October 2007 with Singapore Airlines. An improved version, the A380plus, is under development.<br/><br/>

            The A380's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage; it is narrower than the lower deck but remains comparable to the width of other wide-body aircraft. This gives the A380-800's cabin 550 square metres (5,920 sq ft) of usable floor space,[8] 40% more than the next largest airliner, the Boeing 747-8,[9] and provides seating for 525 people in a typical three-class configuration or up to 853 people in an all-economy class configuration. The A380-800 has a design range of 8,500 nautical miles (15,700 km), serving the fourth- and seventh-longest non-stop scheduled flights in the world, and a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (about 900 km/h, 560 mph or 490 kt at cruising altitude).
