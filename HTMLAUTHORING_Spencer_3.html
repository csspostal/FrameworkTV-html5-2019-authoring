                A recent survey from data-tracking company Ensighten found that 46%<br/>
                of all enterprise brands are concerned about data breaches after<br/>
                other large companies, such as Facebook and Uber, were hacked.<br/>
                Still, 67% have no marketing security in place, the survey found.<br/><br/>

                The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and Hyperledger will combine forces<br/>
                to create an open-source, standards-based cross-platform project to<br/>
                bring businesses distributed ledger solutions. "At Hyperledger, we're<br/>
                very focused at building communities that build a set of software<br/>
                products and many of those touch on and implement Ethereum-related<br/>
                standards, and the EEA is focused on driving a community of<br/>
                organizations around a common set of standards and then certifying<br/>
                applications against those standards," says EEA Executive<br/>
                Director Ron Resnick.<br/><br/>

                Artificial intelligence is expected to significantly affect the<br/>
                workforce in many sectors, with a 190% increase in the number of<br/>
                LinkedIn profiles listing AI skills on their account profiles since<br/>
                2015, according to LinkedIn data. The majority of experts say AI will<br/>
                help make teams more effective and make better decisions, a study<br/>
                from Tata Communications found.<br/><br/>
